Hello there!

This is a hash validator that will help you corroborate that the integrity of your files is still intact.
In this project you will be able to validate the algorithms: MD5, BLAKE2, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-51224 and SHA-3.
The main objective of this repository is to build a tool that uses bash knowledge applied in a cybersecurity field, such as data integrity.

For use this tool, you can execute the following command structure:
---> Command: ./hash-script.sh -f <File_to_Corroborate> -h <Original_Hash>

I hope you enjoy it and that this tool is useful to you.
Have a good one! c:
